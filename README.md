# Last.FM API project

## James.FM

This project was a weekend homework set while studying at CodeClan. The task was fairly open: find an API, and build a website that calls upon it.

I have been a [Last.FM member](https://www.last.fm/user/JAStewart) for more than 12 years, and set myself the task of essentially mirroring the design of the user pages.
